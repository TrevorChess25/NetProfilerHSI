Net Profiler is a user-centric note-saving and organizational system designed to enhance the efficiency of note-taking and managing information about individuals.
Homeland Security's "Net Spider" software gathers categorized data on suspects involved in child exploitation and human trafficking and outputs the data in a csv format. 
Our Net Profiler system transforms this raw data into a structured, visually intuitive format resembling "baseball cards." These cards, combined into "decks," provide a streamlined, 
organized method to investigative note-keeping, allowing for detailed categorization, analysis, and collaboration. 
Each card represents an individual suspect or a specific investigative report. The cards are auto-populated with information such as aliases, usernames, phone numbers,
and other relevant details extracted from input data. The Decks are collections of related cards, grouped for specific cases, themes, or other investigative purposes. 
The decks can be dynamically created, edited, and organized for efficient access and presentation.
The system will accept large datasets to auto-generate multiple cards at once, saving time and effort.
Our system will also eventually use a Language Model to analyze and extract data from unstructured and structured formats like Word documents, OneNote files, and PDFs. 
Users can add, edit, or remove categories and subcategories to custom tailor each card or deck, so that investigators can adapt the system to varying needs.
Each card also has a case notes section allowing agents to record finding, unusual observations, or document action plans. Each input field including case notes are searchable,
making it easy to correlate data and locate specific suspects.
